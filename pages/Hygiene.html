					<p class="card-text">Personal hygiene is how you care for your body. This practice includes bathing,
						washing your hands, brushing your teeth, and more. Good personal hygiene habits are directly
						related to less illnesses and better health. They can also help you feel good about your
						appearance. </p>
					<p class="card-text">Every day, you come into contact with millions of outside germs and viruses.
						They can linger on your body, and in some cases, they may make you sick. </p>
					<p class="card-text">Poor personal hygiene habits, however, can lead to some minor side effects,
						like body odor and greasy skin. They can also lead to more troublesome or even serious issues.
						Poor hygiene habits can also affect your self-esteem. Looking and feeling presentable can give
						you a confidence boost and a sense of pride in your appearance.</p>
